******************
Creating a circuit
******************

A quantum circuit can be built or created in two different ways, 
either programmatically using the qucat.Network class
or using a graphical user interface, using the qucat.GUI class.

After creation, a number of functions are available to compute
relevant physical parameters, extract a Hamiltonian or visualize
the innerworkings of the circuit, see :ref:`circuit-functions`
