.. Qcircuits documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

..  Note about the autogenerated API: 
    I followed these guidelines to get it to work:
    https://wwoods.github.io/2016/06/09/easy-sphinx-documentation-without-the-boilerplate/

    It may be necesary to delete the _autosummary folder
    if changes are made to API.rst with regards to which 
    modules should be included in the docs
